# Snake-game
Modified snake game 🐍     
# My first semester mid-term project 
Modified the simple snake game to enhance user experience.     
## Modifications
1. Add addtional key-binding : in addition to normal arrows(⬅️⬇️⬆️➡️), the "A, W, S, D" keys are also added, so that left-handed user can conveniently control their avatar.      
2. Halloween theme🎃: Since halloween is approaching, I assumed the users will be more excited to try this game if I add spice of Halloween here: The snake and the apple will randomly change color(in Halloween color palette) every time the user runs this game.
3. Background music🎶 : Visual and sounds are the key factors to achieve a true experience (just like a horror movie wouldn't be scary without a background sound). So, I added the song from Harry Potter as a background music.
